\section{Sigma Protocols}

\subsection{Definition}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 3-move form
  \item Completeness
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Protocol should always succeed with correct output, if both parties are honest.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Special soundness
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Given two transcripts, with different challenges it is possible to
        compute an accepting witness for the statement in the relation.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Special Honest Verifier Zero-Knowledge.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Exists an polynomial-time simulator M.
      \item Given statement, x, and challenge, e, output an accepting
        conversation (a, e, z).
      \item Conversation should have the same distribution as an conversation
        between honest parties.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
