\chapter{Towards generalised zero-knowledge compilation}
\label{ch:general_zk}
We have previously seen a concrete instantiation of a $\Sigma$-protocol with the
relation being the discrete logarithm problem, namely Schnorr's protocol. We
have also seen how it was possible to prove Schnorr's protocol to be secure in a
formal setting though \easycrypt.

There exists an infinite set of possible relations, for which we could want to
provide zero-knowledge proofs of. It is therefore infeasible to design a
protocol for each relation and proving its security.

An example of this is the GMW-compiler \dots, or the example system from \cite{zkcrypt}.

We therefore need a more generalised approach, that is able to generate
zero-knowledge proof for an entire family of relations rather than a specific relation.
One such family of relations is the pre-image under group homomorphisms \dots
