\chapter{Generalised Zero-Knowledge protocols}
\label{ch:general_zk}
In this chapter, we introduce generalised zero-knowledge protocols.
In the previous section, we have seen a concrete instantiation of a
$\Sigma$-protocol with the relation being the discrete logarithm problem, namely
Schnorr's protocol (Section \ref{sec:schnorr}).
We have also seen how it is possible to prove the security of $\Sigma$-Protocols
working on composite relations like AND and OR (Section \ref{sec:sigma_comp}).

However, since the need for zero-knowledge is widespread, it is unlikely that a
$\Sigma$-Protocol for proving knowledge of a discrete logarithm suffices.
Consider the example of an authentication system, where each user has a
certificate consisting of his name, income, and birthday. This certificate also has some
additional information to verify the certificate.
A user of this system would then like to prove that he is above the age of 18.
However, the user is not willing to reveal his birthday. To alleviate this,
we could define a $\Sigma$-protocol for proving knowledge of the birthday matching
a valid certificate with the name and income.
We could then image another user being interesting in proving their wealth is
above 5000, but not their precise income. Here, we have the same problem as
before, but with a slightly different relation.

To solve this problem, we could pre-determine all the relations for which
we need zero-knowledge proofs. However, another approach is that of generalised
zero-knowledge protocols.
A generalised zero-knowledge protocol is, like the name suggests, a
protocol able to prove zero-knowledge for an entire class of relations.
One example of such a class of relations is every relation that can be
described as the pre-image of a group homomorphism, \ie\ that the user knows the
input to some function which results in a specific output.

To explore the field of generalised zero-knowledge protocols, we introduce ZKBoo
by \cite{zkboo}.
ZKBoo is a $\Sigma$-Protocol for any relation expressed as the
pre-image of a group homomorphism.
\section{ZKBOO}
\label{sec:zkboo}
In this section we introduce ZKBoo, a generalised $\Sigma$-Protocol for
relations of the form:

\[
  (x, y) \in R \iff f(x) = y
\]

Where $y$ is the public input, $x$ is the witness and $f$ is any function
defined as a circuit over a finite group.

The principle idea of this protocol is based on a technique called ``MPC in the
head''. The idea of ``MPC in the head'' is to run a secure $n$ party MPC protocol for computing
$f$, but with every party being locally simulated, rather than run as part of
the protocol.
By running every party locally, we also remove any communication overhead that the MPC
protocol might incur. Moreover, since the protocol is run locally, we can assume
every party of the MPC protocol to be semi-honest. If the parties where not
semi-honest, then it might be easier to extract the secret input of the parties,
which is not in the interest of the person running the protocol.
These two facts contribute to the ``MPC in the head'' approach being significantly
more efficient than a normal MPC protocol.

We then distribute $x$ into shares $x_1, \dots x_{n}$ for each of the parties. $x$ should be
distributed in such a way that we can reconstruct $x$ from the shares. This
allows us to compute $f(x_{1}, \dots x_{n}) = y$ with the MPC protocol.
In a sense, this corresponds to splitting the computation
into $n$ branches. Consequently, if the branches are then later recombined
we get the actual evaluation of $f$.
Moreover, if we only reveal $d$ of the computational branches, then the inputs
cannot be recovered by the privacy property of the MPC protocol.

In the following section, we introduce the concept of the $(2,3)$-Decomposition,
which is an ``MPC in the head'' protocol for splitting the evaluation of a
circuit into three branches with $2$-privacy and correctness. We then introduce
the actual ZKBoo protocol and describe how the views of an MPC protocol can be
used to prove knowledge of $x$.

\subsection{(2,3)-Function Decomposition}
\label{subsec:decomposition}
The (2,3)-Function decomposition is a general technique for computing the output of
a circuit $f : X \rightarrow Y$ on input value $x \in X$.
The decomposition works by splitting the function evaluation into three
computational branches where each computational branch is a party in an MPC
protocol. The $(2,3)$-Decomposition is essentially a $3$ party MPC protocol with
$2$-privacy that has been altered such that every party is run locally.
Throughout this section, we will refer the (2,3)-Function decomposition
of a function $f$ as $\decomp_{f}$.

We refer to the three parties of the decomposition as $P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}$. The
decomposition then works by splitting the input into an input share for each
party, where the original input can be obtained if all three input shares are
acquired.
Each party then evaluates all the gates of the circuit to a value, as described by
the MPC protocol. Here, we mimic the communication of the parties by letting
them access each other's views. As a general rule, we only allow party $P_{i}$ to
communicate with party $P_{i+1 \mod 3}$.
The view of a party is a list of values that the party has computed so far.
The view of party $P_{i}$ is referred to as $w_{i}$.
For the rest of this chapter, we will omit the ``mod 3'' from the
indexing for the sake of brevity.
Moreover, we assume that each party has access to a random tape $k_{i}$
which describes what the party should do if the protocol asks for a random
choice.

\begin{definition}
  In its most general form the decomposition is a collection of functions:
  \[
    \decomp = \{\text{Share}, \text{Output}, \text{Rec}, \text{Update}\}
  \]

  \texttt{Share} is a procedure for computing the three input shares based on an
  input to $f$. Conceptually, \texttt{Share} takes a value $x$ and splits into
  $n$ shares, called $x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}$. The $n$ shares can then be used to
  reconstruct $x$ by applying the inverse function of share:
  $\texttt{Share}^{-1}(x_{1}, \dots , x_{n}) = x$.
  \texttt{Output} is a function returning the output share from the view of a party.
  \texttt{Rec} is a function reconstructing the output of the function $f$ based on the
  output shares of the parties.

  Last, we have \texttt{Update}(w$^{j}_{i}$, w$^{j}_{i+1}$, k$_{i}$, k$_{i+1}$) $= w^{j+1}_{i}$ which
  is the function used to evaluate the j'th gate of the circuit from the point
  of view of $P_{i}$. Here
  $j$ also refers to the size of the view, i.e. how many shares has been
  computed so far.
\end{definition}

The (2,3)-Decomposition is then the three views produced by running Update on
each party with input shares produced by Share until the entire circuit has been
evaluated.

\paragraph{Security}
Based on the security definitions from MPC (Section \ref{sec:background:mpc}) we
can then define the two fundamental properties from \cite{zkboo} for showing security of
our (2,3)-Function decomposition, namely correctness and privacy.

\begin{definition}[Correctness]
\label{def:decomp_correctness}
A (2,3)-decomposition $\decomp_{f}$ is correct if
$\forall x \in X, \Pr{f(x) = \decomp_{f}(x)} = 1$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Privacy]
\label{def:decomp_privacy}
A (2,3)-decomposition $\decomp_{f}$ is 2-private if it is correct and for all challenges
$e \in \{1,2,3\}$ there exists a probabilistic polynomial-time simulator $S_{e}$
such that:
\[
  \forall x \in x, \left(\{\tape_{i}, \view_{i} \}_{i \in \{e, e+1\}}, \textbf{y}_{e+2} \right)
  \equiv S_{e}(x, y)
\]
Where $\left(\{\tape_{i}, \view_{i} \}_{i \in \{e, e+1\}}, \textbf{y}_{e+2}
\right)$ is produced by running $\decomp$ on input $x$ and $y$ is the result of computing $f(x) = y$
\end{definition}

\subsection{(2,3)-Function Decomposition for Arithmetic circuits}
\label{subsec:general:arith}
Based on the general description of the (2,3)-Decomposition from the previous
section we can now define a concrete (2,3)-Decomposition of arithmetic circuits
as in \cite{zkboo}.

We assume the circuit is expressed in some arbitrary finite field
$\mathbb{Z}_{q}$ such that the circuit can be expressed by the following gates: addition by constant,
multiplication by constant, binary addition, and binary multiplication.
Moreover, we assume that every gate in the circuit is labelled as $[1 \dots N]$ where $N$ is
the total number of gates.
We then implement $\decomp_{\text{ARITH}}$ as:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Share$(x, k_{1}, k_{2}, k_{3})$: Sample random values
    $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}$ such that $x = x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3}$
  \item Output$(w_{i}) = y_{i}$: return the output share of party i.
  \item Rec$(y_{1}, y_{2}, y_{3}) = y_{1} + y_{2} + y_{3} = y$ where $y$ is the
    value of evaluating the circuit normally.
  \item Update(view$^{j}_{i}$, view$^{j}_{i+1}$, k$_{i}$, k$_{i+1}$): Here we
    define procedures based on what type the j'th gate is. Since update only
    append a new share to the view of the party, we only define how to compute
    the new share, since the old shares are immutable.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Addition by constant: where $a$ is the input wire to the gate
        and $\alpha$ is the constant.
        $$ w_{i}[j] =
        \begin{cases} w_{i}[a] + \alpha & \text{if } i = 1 \\
                      w_{i}[a]          & \text{else}       %
        \end{cases}$$
      \item Multiplication by constant: where $a$ is the input wire to the gate
        and $alpha$ is the constant
        $$ w_{i}[j] = w_{i}[a] \cdot \alpha$$
      \item Binary addition: where $a, b$ are the input wires.
        $$
        w_{i}[j] = w_{i}[a] + w_{i}[b]
        $$
      \item Binary multiplication: where $a, b$ are the input wires.
        $$
        w_{i}[j] = w_{i}[a] \cdot w_{i}[b] + w_{i+1}[a] \cdot w_{i}[b] + w_{i}[a] \cdot w_{i+1}[b] + R_{i}(j) - R_{i+1}(j)
        $$
        Where $R_{i}(j)$ is a uniformly random function sampling values using $k_{i}$
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Here, the binary multiplication gate is the most interesting since it needs the
share from another party to compute. The random values are added to hide value
of the share supplied by the other party.
If the random values were not added then it
would be easy to deduce what the share of $P_{i+1}$ is, given access to the
view of party $P_{i}$.

\subsection{ZKBoo}
\label{subsec:general:zkboo}
Based on the (2,3)-Decomposition we are now ready to ZKBoo.

The protocol proceeds as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The prover obtains the circuit representation $C_{f}$ of f and uses
    $\decomp_{C_{f}}$ to produce three views $w_{1}, w_{2},$ and $w_{3}$.
    The prover then commits to all random choices and the views and sends the
    output shares $y_{1}, y_{2}, y_{3}$ of the decomposition and the commitments to the verifier
  \item The verifier pick a number $e \in \{1,2,3\}$
  \item The prover sends views $w_{e}, w_{e+1}$ to the verifier
  \item The verifier checks
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The commitments corresponds to the views
      \item The view $w_{e}$ has been constructed by $\decomp$
      \item Rec$(y_{1}, y_{2}, y_{3}) = y$
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

From this protocol we can see that if the verifier gets access to all three views and
$\decomp_{C_{f}}$ is correct, then we would be able to extract the witness from
the relation since the output of decomposition is equivalent to the result of
the function it decomposes.
By only revealing 2 of the three views, we are ensured by the 2-privacy property
of $\decomp_{C_{f}}$ that the protocol is zero-knowledge. This
property is stronger than the one given by $\Sigma$-protocols, which only offers
zero-knowledge if the verifier is honest. The problem, however, is that the
prover gives the verifier access to the commitment of the last view, so if the
view can be determined based on the commitment, then the zero-knowledge property
does not hold.

Lastly, if the prover is to cheat the verifier he must produce three views where
the output is $y$.
The only option for the prover is if he changes some of
the shares in one of the views, thereby coercing the output to the value he wants.
By doing so, one of the views will deviate from the procedures of $\decomp_{f}$,
and the prove can quickly detect this if he picked the challenge exposing the
view the prover coerced.
If not, then the prover has successfully cheated him.
It is, therefore, necessary to run the protocol
multiple times.

To prove that the above claims hold and that the ZKBoo protocol is secure, we will,
in the following chapter, formalise ZKBoo by utilising our formalisation of
$\Sigma$-Protocols and Commitment Schemes.
