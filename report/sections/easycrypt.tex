\chapter{EasyCrypt}
\label{ch:EasyCrypt}

It this chapter we introduce the \easycrypt proof assistant...

\easycrypt provides us with three important logics: a relational probabilistic
Hoare logic (\textbf{rPHL}), a probabilistic Hoare logic (\textbf{pHL}), and a
Hoare logic.
Furthermore, \easycrypt also has an Higher-order ambient logic, in which the three
previous logics are encoded within. This Higher-order logic allows us to reason
about mathematical constructs, which in turn lets us reason about them within
the different Hoare logics.

\section{Modules}
\label{sec:ec_modules}
To model algorithms within \easycrypt the module construct is provided.
A module is a set of procedures and a record of global variables, where all
procedures are written in \easycrypt embedded programming language, \texttt{pWhile}.
\begin{draft}
pWhile is a mild generalization of the language proposed by Bellare and Rogaway [2006]?
\end{draft}

Modules are, by default, allowed to interact with all other defined modules.
This is a due to all procedures are executed within shared memory. This is to
model actual execution of procedures, where the procedure would have access to
all memory not protected by the operating system.

From this, the set of global variables for any given module, is all its
internally defined global variables and all variables the modules procedures
could potentially read or write during execution. This is checked by a simple
static analysis, which looks at all execution branches within all procedures of the module.

A module can been seen as \easycrypt's abstraction of the class construct
in object-oriented programming languages.

\section{Abstract modules}
\label{sec:ec_abs_modules}
Abstract modules is another features of \easycrypt modelling system, which
enables us to define general structures of modules, without having to implement
the procedures. A procedure without an implementation is called abstract, while
a implemented one (The ones provided by modules) are called concrete.

An important distinction between abstract and non-abstract modules is that,
while non-abstract modules define a global state, in the sense of global
variables, for the procedures to work within, the abstract counter-part does
not. This has two important implications, first it means that defining abstract
modules does not affect the global variables/state of non-abstract modules.
\begin{draft}
Moreover, it is also not possible to prove properties of abstract modules, since
there is no context to prove properties within.
\end{draft}

It is, however, possible to define higher-order abstract modules with access to the global
variables and procedures of another abstract module.

This allows us to quantitate over all possible implementations of an abstract
module in our proofs. This implications of this, is that it is possible to
define adversaries and then proving that no matter what choice the adversary
makes during execution, he will not be able to break the security of the procedure.
