\section{EasyCrypt}
\label{sec:EasyCrypt}

It this chapter we introduce the \easycrypt proof assistant...

\easycrypt provides us with three important logics: a relational probabilistic
Hoare logic (\textbf{rPHL}) and a probabilistic Hoare Logic (\textbf{pHL}).
Furthermore, \easycrypt also has an Higher-order ambient logic, in which the two
previous logics are encoded within. This Higher-order logic allows us to reason
about mathematical constructs, which in turn lets us reason about them within
the Hoare logics.
