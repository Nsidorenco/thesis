\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related_work}

This work exists in the field of formal verification of cryptographic protocols.
Notably our work has been heavily influenced by similar formalisations
\cite{cryptoeprint:2019:1185,DBLP:journals/corr/MetereD17,certicrypt_sigma,zkcrypt,Yao}

Sigma protocols has been done in a lesser extend in \easycrypt. Much of the same
work has been done in Isabelle/CryptHOL by \citeauthor{cryptoeprint:2019:1185}.

\citeauthor{certicrypt_sigma} formalised $\Sigma$-Protocols within CertiCrypt,
and proved the security of the $\Sigma^{\phi}$-Protocol, which proves knowledge
of the pre-image of a group homomorphism. ZKBoo protocol described in section
\ref{sec:zkboo} and the $\Sigma^{\phi}$-Protocol prove knowledge of the same
relation, but ZKBoo has reduced proof size? \todo{Examine differences}.

phi assumes the group homomorphism to be special?

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
For all of the work laid out in this thesis we have used the \easycrypt\ proof
assistant to formally verify all the proofs shown. By using \easycrypt\ we have
had to formulate our proofs ...

\easycrypt\ tries to capture the models in which cryptographers create and prove
protocols. For the most part we feel like \easycrypt has managed to capture
these models quite well both in its \textit{pWhile} language for implementing
protocols and its different logics for proving properties about programs.

The benefit of using an imperative language like \textit{pWhile} over a functional
language used by cryptographic proof assistants like Isabelle/CryptHOL is that most
cryptographic protocols are described in a pseudo-code mimicking imperative
languages. This makes it relatively easy to convert protocols described in
papers into \easycrypt\ implementations. This is clear from the code examples
provided in this thesis, which closely resemble the actual \easycrypt\
implementations whilst being relatively similar to the protocol descriptions
seen in cryptographic papers.

Ultimately, the tool offers the possibility of writing programs both in a
functional style and in an imperative style. It is, however, only programs
written in the imperative style that is allowed to make random choices.

We feel...

Our main problems with using this tool has been the schism between computation
and perfect indistinguishability and the tools steep learning curve.

In particular \easycrypt\ offers its rPHL for proving procedures to be perfect
indistinguishable. If, however, computational indistinguishability is need then
the rPHL logic cannot directly be used, and we instead have to deal with
adversaries comparing procedures. This is a completely sound method for dealing
with indistinguishability of procedures. In \easycrypt\ , however, the technique
of using an adversary to compare procedures then none of the tactics for dealing
with procedures provided by \easycrypt\ can be used, unless all proofs are
converted into adversarial games. \todo{rewrite}

The steep leaning curve is primarily caused by the lack of documentation of new
tactics. At the time of writing this thesis the last update to the \easycrypt\
reference manual \cite{ec_refman} was in 2018. Moreover, the deduction rules by
the different logics that \easycrypt\ provides are not documented anywhere, but
instead have to be found in the papers describing \textbf{CertiCrypt} which is
the Coq-based proof assistant antecedent to \easycrypt.

\section{Future work}
\label{sec:future_work}
In this thesis has created a workable formalisation, as show by the formalisation of
ZKBoo. Various improvement has then been made to the ZKBoo protocol to mainly
reduce to proof size but also to provide zero-knowledge in a post-quantum
context \cite{zkb++}.

With our formalisation we have intentionally focused on the ZKBoo protocol in
isolation but in real applications it would be part of a larger tool chain.
Mainly, ZKBoo requires a circuit with a definable execution order to be secure.
In our formalisation we have assumed the input to be a circuit and defined an
execution order but to complete the tool chain we would need a formalisation of
a procedure converting functions to circuits and a formal proof of the induced
execution order in section \ref{subsec:arith-representation} being semantic preserving.

Moreover we saw in section \ref{subsec:fiat-shamir} that there is a need for
formalising the rewinding lemma to reason about soundness of the Fiat-Shamir
transformation. Moreover, rewinding is a common technique for proving soundness
of zero-knowledge protocols. Formalising the rewinding lemma would then allows
us to reason about be general zero-knowledge protocols than the sub-class of
$\Sigma$-Protocol which we have explored in this thesis.
