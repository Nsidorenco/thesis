Sigma protocols has been done in a lesser extend in \easycrypt. Much of the same
work has been done in Isabelle/CryptHOL by \citeauthor{cryptoeprint:2019:1185}.

\citeauthor{certicrypt_sigma} formalised $\Sigma$-Protocols within CertiCrypt,
and proved the security of the $\Sigma^{\phi}$-Protocol, which proves knowledge
of the pre-image of a group homomorphism. ZKBoo protocol described in section
\ref{sec:zkboo} and the $\Sigma^{\phi}$-Protocol prove knowledge of the same
relation, but ZKBoo has reduced proof size? \todo{Examine differences}.

phi assumes the group homomorphism to be special?

Commitment schemes has been formalized in \easycrypt by
\citeauthor{DBLP:journals/corr/MetereD17}.

\todo{Differences between the works}

formalised general zero knowledge compilers have been explored, with some
notable work by \citeauthor{zkcrypt} and PINOCCIO.
