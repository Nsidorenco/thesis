Generalised $\Sigma$-protocol for relations of the form $\phi(x) = y$, where
$\phi$ and $y$ are public inputs, and $x$ is the witness for the relation.

\begin{itemize}
  \item (2,3)-Decomposition of $\phi$
  \item ``MPC in the head'' of the decomposition
  \item $\Sigma$-protocol proving that MPC computation succeed and was not
    tampered with.
\end{itemize}
