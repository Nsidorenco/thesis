* Project

In this project I aim to formalise Sigma-protocols and commitment schemes within
EasyCrypt with the help of existing formalisations.
Moreover, I seek to understand the differeces between the available
cryptographic proof assistents by comparing my formalisations to existings ones
in the cryptHOL proof assistant.


When fomalising Sigma-protocols I also aim to prove general constructions, like
the OR-construction, and proving them the be secure. Having formalised both
Sigma-Protocols and Commitment schemes I will provide several concrete instantiations
and prove their security in presence of passively corrupted parties.


Time permitting I will either prove the relation between Sigma protocols and
Commitment schemes, the Fiat-Shamir protocol for non-interactive Sigma-protocols
or other possible extensions.
